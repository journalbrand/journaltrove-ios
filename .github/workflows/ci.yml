      # Note: This workflow will be enhanced incrementally:
      # 1. Swift code compilation will be added once we have initial Swift implementation
      # 2. Unit tests will be added when we have testable components
      # 3. UI tests will be added when we have a functional UI

      # We'll add build and test steps when actual Swift code exists
      # No placeholder "echo" commands - we want to know when things aren't working
